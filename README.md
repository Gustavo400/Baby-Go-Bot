# Baby-Go-Bot
First attempt at a discord bot in GoLang, establishing fundamentals.

The functionality is currently limited to Dad Jokes but has the general bot framework and reads messages for commands which you can add functionality to.

The process to add it to a discord server requires an authorization key to properly invite it and you must give it moderater priviledges so that it may access all channels and respond as well.
